# simply an array of boolean logic drills
'''But this is useful:
Whenever you see these Boolean logic statements, you can solve them easily by this simple process:
1. Find an equality test (== or !=) and replace it with its truth.
2. Find each and/or inside parentheses and solve those first.
3. Find each not and invert it.
4. Find any remaining and/or and solve it.
5. When you are done you should have True or False.
