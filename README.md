I put all the code I wrote when reading Learn Python the Hard Way 3rd in this repo.

I found it is hard for me to understand the concept of object-oriented programming, so I stopped there.
I have been learning the ideas relevant since then from other books or tutorials on Python and come to understand it better.
I'll update some scripts and finish in the end the unfinished job.
