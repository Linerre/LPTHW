I put all the code I wrote when reading Learn Python the Hard Way 3rd in this repo.

I found it is hard for me to understand the concept of object-oriented programming, so I stopped there.
I have been getting used to the idea and others relevant ot it since then from other books or tutorials on Python.
I understand it better now.
I'll update some scripts and finish in the end the unfinished job.
